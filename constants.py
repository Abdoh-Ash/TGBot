ABOUT = "I'm a chatbot, by definition.\n\nA chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.\n\nDesigned to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse or pass the industry standard Turing test.\n\nThe term \"ChatterBot\" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs."
PURPOSE = "I exist for multiple reasons, but in general, we could say that I'm more of an experiment for fun. However, I believe that I have a great potential for success."
PING = "Don't worry, still alive and kicking!"
SORRY = "I hate to say this, but unfortunately, I'm not sophisticated enough to understand and react to what you're saying."
